# Git and GitHub

## What is Git?
*Git* is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.  
It is used to track changes in projects, collaborate with teams, and manage source code efficiently.

With Git you can:
- Save different versions of your project.
- Revert to previous states if something goes wrong.
- Work on new features in separate branches.
- Merge changes from different developers.

## What is GitHub?
*GitHub* is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories.  
It adds collaboration tools on top of Git and makes working with code easier.  

GitHub allows you to:
- Store your repositories online.
- Share code with others or keep it private.
- Collaborate using *Pull Requests, **Issues, and **Discussions*.
- Automate workflows with *GitHub Actions*.
- Explore millions of open-source projects.

## Key Difference
- *Git* is the tool that runs locally on your computer.  
- *GitHub* is the service that hosts Git repositories and provides extra features for collaboration.
